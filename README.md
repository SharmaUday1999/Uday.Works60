Features:
- Supports Gasket Mount Boards
- JST connector
- Underglow and in-switch LEDs
- GH60 Layout
- ESD and Over-current protection
- I don't remember the rest :/

It is an Autodesk Eagle Project, I don't have all the footprints handy, but a bit of google should have you set up in no time! I am currently testing a prototype for this but in no way do I guarantee its functionality. This was the biggest PCB project I have ever done and I learned quite alot, feel free to contribute!
